# `crates/mpfs_rts/`

- **Purpose:** Runtime `mpfs_rts`; `kernel/` holds the M-mode kernel (TSF).
- **Owning phase:** P1
- **License:** the runtime sources and the packs made of them GPL-3.0-or-later WITH GCC-exception-3.1; the scripts of this directory are project code, Apache-2.0

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `packs.sha256` | The hashes of the six runtime packs, one line `<sha256>  <profile>-<hart>.tar` each: the SHA-256 of the uncompressed tar stream. Committed; the packs are not. |
| `build/rts/packs/<profile>-<hart>.tar.zst` | The six runtime packs (profile `light`, `light-tasking` or `embedded`; hart class `e51` or `u54`), generated, not committed (`build/` is git-ignored). Each is the source text of one runtime made by `crates/bb-runtimes/build_rts.py`: `gnat/`, `gnarl/`, `runtime.xml`, the project files, `COPYING3`, `COPYING.RUNTIME`; no objects. |
| `make_packs.sh` | `--ensure` (re)generates the packs in `build/rts/packs` that are missing or do not match `packs.sha256`; `--check` regenerates all six into a temporary directory and fails unless every hash equals `packs.sha256`; `--update` regenerates and writes `packs.sha256`. `--out DIR` and `--hashes FILE` name other locations. Exit status 0 ok, 1 difference (`--check`), 2 set-up error. Needs GNU tar, zstd, python3 and sha256sum. |
| `compare_toolchain.sh` | Compares `gnat/` and `gnarl/` of the packs (after `make_packs.sh --ensure`, or `--packs DIR`) with the runtimes shipped with the pinned `gnat_riscv64_elf` (`light-polarfiresoc` and so on, `light-rv64imac`): everything that is not a port unit must be identical. |
| `port_units.list` | The board files that may differ from the toolchain's runtimes, with their source in `crates/bb-runtimes`. |

## Packs and their hashes

The same pattern as the SVD (`svd/PolarfireSoC.sha256`, `tools/svd.py ensure`): the generated artifact is
not in the repository, its hash is, and whoever needs the artifact calls `make_packs.sh --ensure`,
which regenerates what is missing or stale. A change to `crates/bb-runtimes` is committed together with
the new `packs.sha256` (`make_packs.sh --update`); `make_packs.sh --check` (CI, host suite
`tests/host/rts_packs`) fails if the two disagree.

`make_packs.sh` runs `build_rts.py --hart <hart> --profiles <profile> mpfs` per cell, renames
`<profile>-mpfs` to `<profile>-<hart>` and packs it with GNU tar: entries sorted by name, time stamp
2026-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, owner 0:0 (numeric), modes 755 and 644, GNU format (no extended headers), then
`zstd -19 --single-thread`. The stream does not depend on the umask, the time zone, the working
directory, the order in which the file system lists a directory or the time stamps of the checkout.

**Only the tar stream is hashed, not the `.tar.zst`.** The bytes zstd produces depend on its release
(1.5.5 and 1.5.7 write different files for the same stream), so the compression is a cache format that
saves space and time; its bytes are never compared. `zstd -dc build/rts/packs/light-u54.tar.zst | sha256sum`
is the hash of that line in `packs.sha256`.

## Comparison with the toolchain

The common sources of the fork must be the ones of the compiler (GNAT 15.3.1, `tools/toolchain.env`),
or the runtime and the compiler disagree. The runtimes shipped with the toolchain are generated from
the same bb-runtimes tag, so the comparison needs no network:

| Pack | Compared with | Allowed to differ |
|---|---|---|
| `<profile>-u54` | `<profile>-polarfiresoc` | port units |
| `light-e51` | `light-rv64imac` (no FPU, generic board) | port units |
| `light-tasking-e51`, `embedded-e51` | `<profile>-polarfiresoc` | port units and the sources that depend on the FPU (`s-dorepr.adb`, `s-lidosq.adb`, `s-lisisq.adb`: where `light-rv64imac` and `light-rv64imafdc` differ), which must be those of `light-rv64imac` |

A difference outside the list fails; on a deviation prefer the source from the toolchain.
