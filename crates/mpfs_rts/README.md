# `crates/mpfs_rts/`

- **Purpose:** Runtime `mpfs_rts`; `kernel/` holds the M-mode kernel (TSF).
- **Owning phase:** P1
- **License:** the runtime sources and the packs made of them GPL-3.0-or-later WITH GCC-exception-3.1; the scripts of this directory are project code, Apache-2.0

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `packs.sha256` | The hashes of the six runtime packs, one line `<sha256>  <profile>-<hart>.tar` each: the SHA-256 of the uncompressed tar stream. Committed; the packs are not. |
| `build/rts/packs/<profile>-<hart>.tar.zst` | The six runtime packs (profile `light`, `light-tasking` or `embedded`; hart class `e51` or `u54`), generated, not committed (`build/` is git-ignored). Each is the source text of one runtime made by `crates/bb-runtimes/build_rts.py`: `gnat/`, `gnarl/`, `runtime.xml`, the project files, `COPYING3`, `COPYING.RUNTIME`; no objects. |
| `make_packs.sh` | `--ensure` (re)generates the packs in `build/rts/packs` that are missing or do not match `packs.sha256`; `--check` regenerates all six into a temporary directory and fails unless every hash equals `packs.sha256`; `--update` regenerates and writes `packs.sha256`. `--out DIR` and `--hashes FILE` name other locations. Exit status 0 ok, 1 difference (`--check`), 2 set-up error. Needs GNU tar, zstd, python3 and sha256sum. |
| `compare_toolchain.sh` | Compares `gnat/` and `gnarl/` of the packs (after `make_packs.sh --ensure`, or `--packs DIR`) with the runtimes shipped with the pinned `gnat_riscv64_elf` (`light-polarfiresoc` and so on, `light-rv64imac`): everything that is not a port unit must be identical. |
| `gen_runtime.sh` | `gen_runtime.sh <profile> <hart> <cpus> <priv>` builds one variant of the runtime into `build/rts/<profile>-<hart>-cpus<n>-<priv>/` (see below). |
| `mpfs_rts.gpr` | Abstract project: `Runtime_Path` and `Target` from the scenario variables `MPFS_PROFILE`, `MPFS_HART`, `MPFS_CPUS`, `MPFS_PRIV` (and `MPFS_RTS_ROOT` for the root of the variants). |
| `mpfs/`, `overlays/<name>/` | Own port units and overlays, laid over the pack by `gen_runtime.sh` (`gnat/`, `gnarl/`, `ld/` below each). Neither directory exists yet: the first own port unit comes with P1.3. |
| `port_units.list` | The board files that may differ from the toolchain's runtimes, with their source in `crates/bb-runtimes`. |

## Packs and their hashes

The same pattern as the SVD (`svd/PolarfireSoC.sha256`, `tools/svd.py ensure`): the generated artifact is
not in the repository, its hash is, and whoever needs the artifact calls `make_packs.sh --ensure`,
which regenerates what is missing or stale. A change to `crates/bb-runtimes` is committed together with
the new `packs.sha256` (`make_packs.sh --update`); `make_packs.sh --check` (CI, host suite
`tests/host/rts_packs`) fails if the two disagree.

`make_packs.sh` runs `build_rts.py --hart <hart> --profiles <profile> mpfs` per cell, renames
`<profile>-mpfs` to `<profile>-<hart>` and packs it with GNU tar: entries sorted by name, time stamp
2026-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, owner 0:0 (numeric), modes 755 and 644, GNU format (no extended headers), then
`zstd -19 --single-thread`. The stream does not depend on the umask, the time zone, the working
directory, the order in which the file system lists a directory or the time stamps of the checkout.

**Only the tar stream is hashed, not the `.tar.zst`.** The bytes zstd produces depend on its release
(1.5.5 and 1.5.7 write different files for the same stream), so the compression is a cache format that
saves space and time; its bytes are never compared. `zstd -dc build/rts/packs/light-u54.tar.zst | sha256sum`
is the hash of that line in `packs.sha256`.

## Comparison with the toolchain

The common sources of the fork must be the ones of the compiler (GNAT 15.3.1, `tools/toolchain.env`),
or the runtime and the compiler disagree. The runtimes shipped with the toolchain are generated from
the same bb-runtimes tag, so the comparison needs no network:

| Pack | Compared with | Allowed to differ |
|---|---|---|
| `<profile>-u54` | `<profile>-polarfiresoc` | port units |
| `light-e51` | `light-rv64imac` (no FPU, generic board) | port units |
| `light-tasking-e51`, `embedded-e51` | `<profile>-polarfiresoc` | port units and the sources that depend on the FPU (`s-dorepr.adb`, `s-lidosq.adb`, `s-lisisq.adb`: where `light-rv64imac` and `light-rv64imafdc` differ), which must be those of `light-rv64imac` |

A difference outside the list fails; on a deviation prefer the source from the toolchain.

## Variant build

`gen_runtime.sh <profile> <hart> <cpus> <priv>` (profile `light`, `light-tasking` or `embedded`; hart `e51` or `u54`; cpus `1`; priv `m`:
SMP is P8 and U mode P7, so other values are refused) does this:

1. gets the pack with `make_packs.sh --ensure --cells <profile>-<hart>` (`build/rts/packs/<profile>-<hart>.tar.zst`, generated only if it is missing, unreadable or does not have its hash in `packs.sha256`; about 20 s then, nothing otherwise) and unpacks it into a work directory next to the result;
2. lays the own port units (`mpfs/`) and then the overlays (`overlays/<name>/`, in the order of their names) over it: `gnat/*` and `gnarl/*` replace or add sources, `ld/*` goes to `ld/`;
3. builds `libgnat.a` with `runtime_build.gpr` and, except for `light`, `libgnarl.a` with `ravenscar_build.gpr`: ordinary static library projects, `-XBUILD=Production` (`MPFS_RTS_BUILD=Debug|Assert` for the other build modes of the pack's `target_options.gpr`); the `-march` and `-mabi` of the hart class come from `runtime.xml`, `-mcmodel=medany` is the spec default of the toolchain;
4. leaves `adainclude/` (all sources), `adalib/` (`.ali` files, `libgnat.a`, `libgnarl.a`), `ld/` (the `-L` directory of the link, which the pack calls `ld_user`; the partition data brings the linker scripts), `runtime.xml`, the license texts and the stamp `.mpfs_rts.stamp`.

The result moves into place in one step, so an aborted build leaves no half variant. The **cache key** in the stamp is the sha256 of the pack (the SHA-256 of its uncompressed tar stream, the hash that `packs.sha256` records: the compressed bytes depend on the zstd release and are not used; if the sources of the fork changed and `packs.sha256` is stale, `--ensure` warns and the key follows the pack that was really generated), the port units, the overlays, the switches (variant, build mode, the script itself) and the toolchain (the name of the installed GNAT directory, which carries the Alire version and a hash, and the versions that `gcc` and `gprbuild` report). A variant whose stamp has the same key and whose files are there is reused: `./x build tasking_test -P light-tasking --hart e51` runs the script every time and the second run prints `gen_runtime: light-tasking-e51-cpus1-m is up to date (key ...)` after 0.1 s instead of building for about 15 s. `--check` only reports (exit 1: it would build), `--force` rebuilds. `./x clean --rts` removes `build/rts`.

An application selects the variant with `mpfs_rts.gpr`:

    with "../../crates/mpfs_rts/mpfs_rts.gpr";
    project App is
       for Target use Mpfs_Rts.Target;
       for Runtime ("Ada") use Mpfs_Rts.Runtime_Path;

`./x build` does that for an example whose `example.conf` has `RUNTIME=mpfs_rts` (`PROFILE=` is the profile for `-P auto`): it sets the four variables (`MPFS_CPUS` is the number of harts of `--harts`, 1 without), calls `gen_runtime.sh` and then `gprbuild`. `examples/tasking_test` is the minimal example for this (a periodic task and an environment task, no output); the real test of P1.13 replaces it.

Reproducibility: the switches are not recorded in the debug info (`-gno-record-gcc-switches`) and the paths of the sources are mapped to `./build/rts/<variant>/adainclude` (relative to the repository root, like `ADA_MPFS_SDK` for the examples), so an image linked with a variant does not depend on the directory of the checkout; `./x repro` covers `tasking_test`.

Known limit of this step: the build mode `Production` keeps the `-gnatp` of the pack's `target_options.gpr` (the plan wants no `-gnatp` outside the TSF: that is a change of the fork, not of the build).
